# Assignment 3 – Portfolio Enhancements

Portfolio site built with semantic HTML, modern CSS (variables, grid, flexbox), and JavaScript for dynamic UI. This iteration adds sorting, state persistence, and an inspirational quotes fetch with graceful fallbacks.

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic projects with filter + sort (by year/title) and year badges.
- Contact form with inline validation (length + email checks).
- Theme toggle persisted in `localStorage`.
- State management: remembered visitor name, simulated login toggle, show/hide projects toggle (all persisted).
- Conditional guidance card (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced).
- Inspirational quote pulled from DummyJSON API with fallback notice.
- Performance tweaks: lazy-loaded images.

## 🖥️ Run Locally
